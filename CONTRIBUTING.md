# Contributing to tetra-rp

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ (3.12 recommended)
- uv package manager
- Git

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/tetra-rp.git
cd tetra-rp

# Install dependencies and package in editable mode
make dev
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
RUNPOD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Get your API key from: https://docs.runpod.io/get-started/api-keys

**When is the API key needed?**
- Remote execution features (`@remote` decorator)
- Resource deployment and management
- Integration tests that interact with Runpod API

**When is the API key NOT needed?**
- Local development with `flash run` (local server only)
- `flash init` command (project scaffolding)
- Unit tests (mocked API calls)
- Code formatting, linting, type checking

If you don't have an API key, you can still:
- Run unit tests: `make test-unit`
- Format and lint code: `make format lint`
- Work on CLI commands and local features
- Build and validate packages: `make build`

## Code Standards

### Type Hints Required

All functions must have type hints:

```python
# Required
def process_data(items: list[dict[str, Any]]) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Process items and return DataFrame."""
    pass

# Not acceptable
def process_data(items):
    pass
```

### Error Handling Pattern

Use specific exceptions with context:

```python
# Correct
try:
    result = external_api_call()
except requests.HTTPError as e:
    logger.error(f"API call failed: {e.response.status_code}")
    raise ServiceUnavailableError(f"External service error: {e}") from e

# Incorrect
try:
    result = external_api_call()
except:
    print("Error occurred")
```

### Testing Requirements

Write tests before implementation (TDD approach):

1. Write failing test
2. Implement minimum code to pass test
3. Refactor while keeping tests green

All new features require:
- Unit tests in [tests/unit/](tests/unit/)
- Integration tests if external dependencies involved
- Minimum 35% code coverage (aim for 70% on critical paths)

Test structure follows Arrange-Act-Assert pattern:

```python
def test_user_creation():
    # Arrange
    user_data = {"email": "test@example.com", "name": "Test User"}

    # Act
    user = User.create(**user_data)

    # Assert
    assert user.email == user_data["email"]
    assert user.id is not None
```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. Create feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make changes following code standards

3. Run quality checks locally:
   ```bash
   # Format and lint
   make format
   make lint

   # Type checking
   make typecheck

   # Tests with coverage
   make test-coverage

   # Run all quality checks
   make quality-check
   ```

## Code Intelligence System

### Overview

The project uses AST-based code indexing to enable fast symbol lookup and exploration. This reduces token usage by ~85% when Claude Code explores the codebase.

### Setup

Generate the code intelligence index after cloning the repository or making significant code changes:

```bash
make index
```

This creates `.code-intel/flash.db` containing indexed symbols.

### Usage

**List all classes in the framework:**

```bash
make query-classes
```

**Find specific symbol:**

```bash
make query SYMBOL=ServerlessEndpoint
```

**Get class interface (methods without implementations):**

```bash
uv run python scripts/code_intel.py interface LiveServerless
```

**List symbols in a file:**

```bash
uv run python scripts/code_intel.py file tetra_rp/decorators.py
```

**List all symbols:**

```bash
make query-all
```

### For Claude Code

**Automatic Integration (Recommended):**

Claude Code automatically uses the MCP code intelligence server when exploring the codebase. This provides:

- **Automatic tool discovery**: 5 specialized tools for code exploration
- **85% token reduction**: No need to read full files for structure queries
- **Instant results**: Direct database queries instead of file parsing

The MCP server is configured in `.mcp.json` and automatically activated when you open this project in Claude Code. Use the `/tetra-explorer` skill to get guidance on best exploration practices.

Available MCP tools:
- `find_symbol` - Search for classes, functions, methods
- `list_classes` - Browse all framework classes
- `get_class_interface` - View class methods without implementations
- `list_file_symbols` - Explore file structure without full content
- `find_by_decorator` - Find all symbols with specific decorators

**Manual CLI Usage (for non-Claude-Code exploration):**

1. Query the index to understand structure:

```bash
# Find a specific class or function
uv run python scripts/code_intel.py find <symbol>

# List all classes
make query-classes

# Show class interface
uv run python scripts/code_intel.py interface <ClassName>
```

2. Only read full files when implementation details are needed
3. This reduces token usage by ~85% for exploration tasks

**Example:**

```bash
# Instead of reading full file (500+ tokens):
# Do this query first (50 tokens):
uv run python scripts/code_intel.py file tetra_rp/decorators.py

# Then only read full file if implementation details needed
```

### Architecture

**Indexer** (`scripts/ast_to_sqlite.py`):
- Parses Python framework files using built-in `ast` module
- Extracts: classes, functions, methods, decorators, type hints, docstrings
- Stores in SQLite with optimized indexes for common queries

**Query Interface** (`scripts/code_intel.py`):
- CLI built with `typer` and `rich`
- Commands: `list-all`, `find`, `interface`, `file`
- Performance: <10ms per query

**Database** (`.code-intel/flash.db`):
- SQLite database with symbols table
- Indexed on: symbol_name, file_path, kind, decorator_json
- Typical size: 100-500KB

### MCP Server Setup

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server automatically provides code intelligence tools to Claude Code without any setup. Simply open this project in Claude Code and the server will:

1. Start automatically (configured in `.mcp.json`)
2. Discover the 5 code intelligence tools
3. Enable Claude to query the database instead of reading files

**Verify MCP Server is Running:**

Claude Code shows available tools in the UI. If you don't see the code intelligence tools, try:

1. Ensure the code intelligence index is generated:
   ```bash
   make index
   ```

2. Restart Claude Code to reload MCP servers

3. Check that `.mcp.json` exists in the project root

### Troubleshooting

**Error: "Index not found"**

```bash
make index  # Generate index
```

**Error: "SyntaxError during indexing"**
- Check Python file syntax
- Indexer skips malformed files automatically

**Stale index**
- Regenerate after significant code changes:
  ```bash
  make index
  ```

**MCP Server not connecting in Claude Code**
- Ensure code intelligence index exists: `make index`
- Check `.mcp.json` file exists in project root
- Restart Claude Code to reload MCP configuration
- Try running the server manually: `uv run python scripts/mcp_code_intel_server.py`
