class StateManagerClient:
    """GraphQL client for State Manager manifest persistence.

    The State Manager persists manifest state via RunPod GraphQL API,
    providing reconciliation capabilities for the mothership to track
    deployed resources across boots.

    Thread Safety:
        Uses asyncio.Lock to serialize read-modify-write operations,
        preventing race conditions during concurrent resource updates.

    Architecture:
        Manifest updates follow a read-modify-write pattern:
        1. Fetch environment -> activeBuildId
        2. Fetch build -> manifest
        3. Merge changes into manifest
        4. Call updateFlashBuildManifest mutation

    Performance:
        Each update requires 3 GraphQL roundtrips. Consider batching
        updates when provisioning multiple resources.
