class FlashApp:
    """Flash app resource for managing applications, environments, and builds.

    FlashApp provides the interface for Flash application lifecycle management including:
    - Creating and managing flash apps
    - Managing environments within apps
    - Uploading and deploying builds
    - Registering endpoints and network volumes to environments

    Lifecycle Management:
        - Constructor (__init__): Creates instance without I/O by default
        - Factory methods (from_name, create, get_or_create): Recommended for async contexts
        - Hydration: Lazy-loads app ID from server via _hydrate()
        - All API methods call _hydrate() automatically before execution

    Thread Safety:
        - Hydration is protected by asyncio.Lock to prevent concurrent API calls
        - Safe to call _hydrate() multiple times from different coroutines
        - All async methods are safe for concurrent use after hydration

    Usage Patterns:
        # Factory method (recommended in async context)
        app = await FlashApp.from_name("my-app")

        # Constructor with eager hydration (blocks, creates event loop)
        app = FlashApp("my-app", eager_hydrate=True)

        # Constructor without hydration (deferred until first API call)
        app = FlashApp("my-app")
        await app._hydrate()  # Explicit hydration

    GraphQL Query Philosophy:
        - List operations fetch only top-level attributes
        - Child resources queried separately by ID or name
        - Direct queries fetch one level deeper (app + envs/builds, not env resources)
