Mothership Endpoint Configuration

The mothership endpoint serves your FastAPI application routes.
It is automatically deployed as a CPU-optimized load-balanced endpoint.

To customize this configuration:
- Modify worker scaling: change workersMin and workersMax values
- Use GPU load balancer: import LiveLoadBalancer instead of CpuLiveLoadBalancer
- Change endpoint name: update the 'name' parameter

To disable mothership deployment:
- Delete this file, or
- Comment out the 'mothership' variable below

# Increase scaling for high traffic
# mothership = CpuLiveLoadBalancer(
#     name="mothership",
#     workersMin=2,

# Use GPU-based load balancer instead of CPU
# (requires importing LiveLoadBalancer)
# from tetra_rp import LiveLoadBalancer
# mothership = LiveLoadBalancer(
#     name="mothership",
