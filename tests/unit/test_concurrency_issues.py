"""
Unit tests for concurrency issues in tetra_rp.

This module tests race conditions and thread safety issues in:
1. ResourceManager singleton and resource provisioning
2. Global function cache access
3. File-based state persistence
4. Class serialization caching

All tests are designed to expose the race conditions identified in the code review.
